Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We have made a plan that has an outline of what type of scenes we will have. We have also used a specfic engine to help us map out the specfic dialouge between the user(PI) and the specific characters of the game. The user will have different choices to choose from that will give them different outcomes/clues. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have not had a chance to look at the animation part of our plan. We need to find sprites and specfic backgrounds for the game. We also have to see if we can input a type of mini game that will allow the user to do a find an object in a room. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Not any so far, the only one rightnow would be the animation.
